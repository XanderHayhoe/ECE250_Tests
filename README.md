# ECE250 Open Source Tests
How to use: 
put your a.out (if on mac/linux/WSL) in the project_X folder. then, run `python3 test.py` to invoke the python script and run your tests. Please label each test as `testxx.in` in the `in` folder and make sure you have a corresponding `testxx.out` in the `out` folder. Also, ensure they are in sequential order. If you are on Windows, then please make a PR fixing the script, as I am unable to read the files on Windows only. I will be working on a patch for windows soon!
